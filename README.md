SparseInsight
===============================
Using Feature Selection to Mitigate Curse of Dimensionality and Enhance Data Relevance in High-Dimensional and Sparse Data

SparseInsight is an open-source feature selection repository in Python developed by Data Scientists in High Dimention Sprase Lab at Ben-Gurion University.
Our research seeks to answer two key subquestions: 
  (1) Can feature selection reduce dimensions effectively in HD datasets?  
  (2) is FS essential in real sparse and HD datasets? 

We explore these questions to shed light on the utility of FS in enhancing data analysis efficiency, model interpretability, and possibly mitigating the curse-of-dimensionality, if it indeed exists and relates to the p/n ratio. Our research analyzes 50 HD datasets from reputable sources spanning 1999-2021, with p/n ratios ranging from 1 to 262.  We established a GitHub pipeline with 11 FS algorithms, spanning 1972-2021. We systematically optimized FS across 50 HD datasets, conducting 30,000+ experiments with varied hyperparameters.
